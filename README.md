# PERN Stack Budget Planner

This was a project to help me learn how to develop a full-stack web application. Supabase was used for the backend and user authentication. Initially PostGreSQL was used as a local database before it was deployed through Supabase. Render was used to deploy the backend to create API endpoints. The frontend was created using React.js and deployed through Vercel.

In this web application, users can create an account and login to a personal budget planner. You can add different transactions along with the date, type, category, amount, and description, and a dashboard will summarize your transactions for you.
